          <h2>Aztec Empire</h2>
          <div class="line-dec"></div>
          <span style="color: aqua;">The Aztec Empire flourished between c. 1345 and 1521 CE and, at its greatest extent, covered most of
            northern Mesoamerica. Aztec warriors were able to dominate their neighbouring states and permit rulers
            such as Motecuhzoma II to impose Aztec ideals and religion across Mexico. Highly accomplished in
            agriculture and trade, the last of the great Mesoamerican civilizations was also noted for its art and
            architecture which ranks amongst the finest ever produced on the continent.

                <p>
                  This map of the Aztec Empire, again, shows general areas of influence. It's not meant to show exact
                  locations and borders. First, you'll see a couple of pyramids and a large T. This represents the
                  Aztec capitol, Tenochtitlán, now Mexico City, and the neighbouring Teotihuacán. This area, enclosed
                  in the solid black line, was the Aztec heartland - the area that was directly and most solidly
                  controlled by the emperor in Tenochtitlán. This is where the Aztec empire basically started, then
                  moving out to the east, finally expanding west and south.
                  The larger outline shows the general area of influence of the Aztecs, but this influence differed.
                  The majority of this area included cities and towns that had been conquered by the Mexica people
                  (who controlled the empire). These were cities that paid tribute on a regular basis to the Aztec
                  empire.
                  But you'll also see areas with diagonal lines. This represents general regions that were not
                  necessarily required to pay tribute, but they did protect the empire from enemies.

                <p>
                  In 1502 Montezuma succeeded his uncle Ahuitzotl as the leader of an empire that had reached its
                  greatest extent, stretching to what is now Honduras and Nicaragua, but that was weakened by the
                  resentment of the subject tribes to the increasing demands for tribute and victims for the religious
                  sacrifices. Montezuma was commander of the army and organized extensive expeditions of conquest in
                  deference to Huitzilopochtli, the god of war and of the sun. Through astrologers, the god instilled
                  in the emperor a kind of fatalism in the face of an uncertain future.<br></br>
                  Montezuma tried to buy off Cortés, but the Spaniard made alliances with those subject tribes who
                  hated Aztec rule. Welcomed into the capital city of Tenochtitlán by Montezuma, Cortés realized it
                  was a trap and, instead, made the emperor his prisoner, believing that the Aztecs would not attack
                  as long as he held Montezuma captive. Montezuma’s submission to the Spaniards, however, had eroded
                  the respect of his people. According to Spanish accounts, he attempted to speak to his subjects and
                  was assailed with stones and arrows, suffering wounds from which he died three days later.

                <p>
                  The capital of the Aztec empire was Tenochtitlan, built on a raised island in Lake Texcoco. Modern
                  Mexico City is built on the ruins of Tenochtitlan.
                  <br></br>
                  From the 13th century, the Valley of Mexico was the heart of Aztec civilization; here the capital of
                  the Aztec Triple Alliance, the city of Tenochtitlan, was built upon raised islets in Lake Texcoco.
                  The Triple Alliance was comprised of Tenochtitlan along with their main allies of Acolhuas of
                  Texcoco and Tepanecs of Tlacopan. They formed a tributary empire expanding its political hegemony
                  far beyond the Valley of Mexico, conquering other city-states throughout Mesoamerica. At its
                  pinnacle, Aztec culture had rich and complex mythological and religious traditions, and reached
                  remarkable architectural and artistic accomplishments. In 1521 Hernán Cortés, along with a large
                  number of Nahuatl-speaking indigenous allies, conquered Tenochtitlan and defeated the Aztec Triple
                  Alliance under the leadership of Hueyi Tlatoani Moctezuma II.

          <span style="color: aqua;">Aztec cuisine is the cuisine of the former Aztec Empire and the Nahua peoples of the Valley of Mexico
            prior to European contact in 1519. The most important staple was corn, a crop that was so important to
            Aztec society that it played a central part in their mythology.

                  The Aztec diet was dominated by fruit and vegetables, as domesticated animals were limited to dogs,
                  turkeys (totolin), ducks, and honey bees. Game (especially rabbits, deer and wild pigs), fish,
                  birds, salamanders, algae (used to make cakes), frogs, tadpoles and insects were also a valuable
                  food source. The most common crops were maize (centli, famously used to make tortillas but also
                  tamales and gruel), amaranth (a grain), sage, beans (etl), squash, and chile peppers. Red and green
                  tomatoes were cultivated (but were much smaller than the modern variety), as were white sweet
                  potatoes, jícama (a type of turnip), chayote (vegetable pear), the nopal cactus, and peanuts. The
                  Aztecs also grew many types of fruit including guavas, papayas, custard apples, mamey, zapotes, and
                  chirimoyas. Snacks included popcorn and the sweet baked leaves of the maguey agave.

                <p>
                  In Aztec society, land could be owned by communities (calpolli) and parceled out to individual
                  families for cultivation, or farmers could be resident tenants (mayeque) on large, privately owned
                  estates. Rent was paid in kind to the landowners who were either Aztec nobles (pipiltin), warriors
                  given the land as a reward for services rendered, or the king himself (tlatoani), who all managed
                  their estates through intermediary administrators. On a smaller scale, it was also typical for
                  commoners (macehualtin) to have their own garden plot (calmil), which could supply the family with
                  food. At the bottom of the social strata were slaves (tlacohtin) who, besides working in other
                  industries, were also widely engaged in agriculture.<br></br>
                  Two groups of agricultural workers may be distinguished - the general farm labourers who tended the
                  fields, planted, and irrigated crops, and the more specialised horticulturalists who had knowledge
                  of seeding, transplanting, crop rotation, and the best times to plant and harvest. The latter
                  information could be determined from the tonalamatl almanacs, and they not only considered climatic
                  conditions but also auspicious periods and events after which planting and harvesting should take
                  place.

                <h4 class="h4head">The Aztec Rain Festival</h4>
                <p>
                  The Aztecs celebrated the first rain festival at the beginning of the agricultural year in February,
                  during the course of which a priest or shaman carried out a number of rituals to encourage rainfall.

                  The second rain festival was offered to Tlaloc and the other rain gods in March once flowers had
                  begun to bloom, as this signified the arrival of the first new life from the earth.
                  <br></br>
                  A third Aztec rain festival was celebrated in autumn in order to encourage rainfall. At this
                  festival, the Aztec people created shapes of small mountains and images of the god, Tlaloc, as he
                  was thought to live on a high mountain.

                  As modern folklore has it, it poured with rain during the Olympic Games in Mexico City in 1968
                  because some students had created a statue of Tlaloc and sat on its top. Legend has it that Tlaloc
                  did not quite approve of this, and as a result, the sky came down during the Olympic Games.

                <h4 class="h4head">The Aztec Fire Festival</h4>
                <p>
                  On the day of the New Fire Ceremony, all the fires in the Valley of Mexico were extinguished before
                  sundown. Great masses of Aztec people journeyed from out of Mexico City to a temple several miles
                  away on the Hill of the Star, following the lead of their priests or shamans. On this hill the
                  priests lingered, waiting for a celestial sign, as the firmament of the stars could be observed
                  quite well from this spot. The sign would signify whether the world would end or whether a new cycle
                  would begin.
                  <br></br>
                  The marrow of this ritual was actualized when the constellation known as the Pleiades passed the
                  zenith, enabling life to go on as it had. Had it failed to do so, the sun, the stars and other
                  celestial bodies would turn into ferocious beasts who would descend to the earth and devour all the
                  Aztecs. Then an earthquake would finish the destruction.
                  Each year, once a favorable interpretation of the celestial signal was made, burning torch-lights
                  were carried by runners all through the valley to rekindle the fires in each house.

                <p>
                  The Cuauhtemoc Festival is celebrated in August. Cuauhtemoc was the last emperor of the Aztecs,
                  whose memory is honoured every year during a celebration held in front of his statue on the Paseo de
                  la Reforma in Mexico City.

                  At this festival, the story of his life is told both in native Indian languages and in Spanish,
                  detailing the struggle against the Spaniards while Conchero dancers perform their world-famous
                  dances, wearing feathered headdresses trimmed with mirrors and beads.

                  They carry with them images of Jesus Christ and saints to represent the blending of Aztec and
                  Spanish cultures. Most of these Conchero groups consist of 50 or more dancers, each performing in
                  their own rhythm and to their own accompaniment. The tempo rises gradually until it reaches a sudden
                  climax, which is followed by a moment of silence.

          <h2>Militry and Wars</h2>
          <div class="line-dec"></div>
          <span style="color: aqua;">Aztec warfare concerns the aspects associated with the militaristic conventions, forces, weaponry and
            strategic expansions conducted by the Late Postclassic Aztec civilizations of Mesoamerica, including
            particularly the military history of the Aztec Triple Alliance involving the city-states of Tenochtitlan,
            Texcoco, Tlacopan and other allied polities of the central Mexican region.

                <p>
                  Aztec army was a well organized and well structured army in terms of ranks, discipline and commands.
                  Since the Aztec army was well organized, they separated their army in two big groups. The common
                  warriors or even the beginners were part of the Aztec Regular unit, performing straight and simple
                  tasks and using common military weapons and armor. There were many common warriors so the regular
                  unit was really large in number. The second group was the Elite Aztec Warriors. They were usually
                  composed of highly experienced veterans or naturally talented and even knowledgeable warriors. They
                  had extraordinary skills on the battlefield and they were not as high in number compared to regular
                  unit. They used top weaponry and armor to perform dangerous tasks and risky events. The Regular unit
                  can be compared to as the U.S. military.

                <h4 class="h4head">Aztec Flower War</h4>
                <p>
                  The war all started with the emperor of the Aztec empire, Tlacaelel. Tlacaelel was rewriting the
                  history books by expanding his civilization to the whole area of Mexico and he created one of the
                  strongest military at the point in time. The Aztecs soon encountered the Tlaxcalans who were an
                  arising civilization and were inching closer to gaining as much power the Aztecs had. The two
                  civilizations were really close in terms of religion and culture. The war is very interesting,
                  instead of taking land and killing people, the two civilizations agreed to start a war based on
                  capturing prisoners for sacrifice.
                  <br></br>Soon the flower wars became a traditional culture and they went at each other for decades.
                  The prisoners captured often did not scream and were not pleading for help, they went willingly to
                  be sacrificed and thought of it as a religious part in culture.
                  <br></br>Later, the war began to backfire for the Aztecs, they kept losing too many people each
                  time, the military and the population was decreasing heavily. Soon the 2 civilizations ended the
                  flower wars because of the spanish trying to invade Mexico. The Tlaxcalans soon joined the spanish
                  and fought against the Aztecs.
